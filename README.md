# GPS/Data Application

This repository contains everything needed to decode DMR GPS packets and SMS for HBLink3. This application can act as a master or peer and receive data as a group call or private call.

Files modified from original master branch of HBLink3:

* bridge.py
* config.py 

#### Required modules

* pynmea2
* aprslib

This should work for DMR radios that send location data as a UTF-8 NMEA sentence. I am hopping to add support for more radios in the future.

### Differences in branches

* **GPS**: Contains the GPS/Data Application.
* **aprs_features**: Contains the GPS/Data Application and a modified version of the APRS implementation for repeaters and hotspots by **IU7IGU**. (See [https://github.com/iu7igu/hblink3-aprs](https://github.com/iu7igu/hblink3-aprs) for his work). I combined these for convenience.

## Confirmed working:
Actually tested

* Anytone D878
* Anytone D578


## Highly suspected to work:
Not tested yet, but appears to utilize NMEA sentence.

* Anytone D868
* BTech DMR-6x2
* Alinco DJ-MD5TGP

## Would like to test:

* AIlunce HD1

## Features

* Decode GPS locations and upload APRS position packets
* Each user/DMR ID can customize APRS position
* Ability to receive data as a private call or group call
* Trigger a command or script via DMR SMS


## How it works

A user should configure their radio for the DMR ID of the application and private or group call. When a position is received by the application, it will extract the coordinates and create an APRS position packet. The application will find the callsign of the user based on the sending radio's DMR ID. It is essential to have an up to date subscriber_ids file for this to work. A predefined APRS SSID is appended to the callsign. The APRS location packet is then uploaded to APRS-IS. No setup is required beforehand on the part of the user. This is pretty much "plug and play."

For example, N0CALL has a DMR ID of 1234567. N0CALL's radio sends a position to the application. The application will query the subscriber_ids file for DMR ID 1234567. The result will be N0CALL. An APRS location pack is created and uploaded to APRS-IS.

## Individual user/DMR ID APRS settings

By default, all APRS positions will have an SSID of 15, a default comment, and the callsign of the DMR user. These default settings can be changed. 

The comment, SSID, and icon can be set for each individual user/DMR ID the application sees. The application stores all the setting in a file. You may have different SSIDs, icons, and comments for different DMR IDs. This is done via DMR SMS using the following commands:

* `
@SSID` - Change SSID of user callsign.

* `
@ICON` - Change the icon of the APRS position. *See [http://aprs.net/vm/DOS/SYMBOLS.HTM](http://aprs.net/vm/DOS/SYMBOLS.HTM) for icon list.

* `
@COM` - Change the comment of the APRS

Send a DMR SMS to the configured dmr_data_id in the application with the desired command followed by the value. For example, to change your icon to a dog, the command would be `@ICON /p` (see the icon table for values). Changing your SSID is as simple as `@SSID 7`, and `@COM Testing 123` will change the comment.

To remove any of the stored values, just send the appropriate command without any input. `@COM` will remove the stored comment, `@ICON` will remove the stored icon, and `@COM` will remove the strored comment. Any position now reports sent will have the default settings.

## Configuration

See hblink_SAMPLE.cfg, rules_SAMPLE.py, and gps_data_SAMPLE.cfg for examples.

## PROJECT: Open Source HomeBrew Repeater Proctol Client/Master. ##

**UPDATES:**

**PURPOSE:** Thanks to the work of Jonathan Naylor, G4KLX; Hans Barthen, DL5DI; Torsten Shultze, DG1HT we have an open protocol for internetworking DMR repeaters. Unfortunately, there's no generic client and/or master stacks. This project is to build an open-source, python-based implementation. You are free to use this software however you want, however we ask that you provide attribution in some public venue (such as project, club, organization web site). This helps us see where the software is in use and track how it is used.

For those who will ask: This is a piece of software that implements an open-source, amateur radio networking protocol. It is not a network. It is not intended to be a network. It is not intended to replace or circumvent a network. People do those things, code doesn't.
  
**PROPERTY:**  
This work represents the author's interpretation of the HomeBrew Repeater Protocol, based on the 2015-07-26 documents from DMRplus, "IPSC Protocol Specs for homebrew DMR repeater" as written by Jonathan Naylor, G4KLX; Hans Barthen, DL5DI; Torsten Shultze, DG1HT, also licenced under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.

**WARRANTY**
None. The owners of this work make absolutely no warranty, express or implied. Use this software at your own risk.

**PRE-REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE:**  
This document assumes the reader is familiar with Linux/UNIX, the Python programming language and DMR.  

**Using docker version**

To work with provided docker setup you will need:
* A private repository with your configuration files (all .cfg files in repo will be copyed to the application root directory on start up)
* A service user able to read your private repository (or be brave and publish your configuration, or be really brave and give your username and password to the docker)
* A server with docker installed
* Follow this simple steps:

Build your own image from source

```bash

docker build . -t millaguie/hblink:3.0.0

```

Or user a prebuilt one in docker hub: millaguie/hblink:3.0.0

Wake up your container

```bash
touch /var/log/hblink.log
chown 65000  /var/log/hblink.log
 run -v /var/log/hblink.log:/var/log/hblink.log -e GIT_USER=$USER -e GIT_PASSWORD=$PASSWORD -e GIT_REPO=$URL_TO_REPO_WITHOUT_HTTPS://  -p 54000:54000  millaguie/hblink:3.0.0
 ```
